Bordered by the aforementioned parks, the Colorado River on the east and Lake Powell to the south, the federally designated National Monument sprawls over hundreds of miles of rocks, sand, cactus, and the occasional oasis.

To see the area, our group of 8 decided to tackle a 4-day bikepacking trip around the southern Utah desert. We would travel on a mix of roads–everything from rough gravel to paved highways, and try to camp near water sources so that we’d be able to cook each night. We ended up getting a bit more than we bargained for–280 miles in the desert sun will make your mind spin–but through the process and long days in the saddle, we learned something about ourselves and each other.

When I first hiked a section of Nüümü Poyo (the “people’s trail” in the Paiute language, also called the John Muir Trail) in 2014, I had just read Wild by Cheryl Strayed. A few years before, I’d read A Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson. I’d read John Krakauer’s Into the Wild. I’d read Alfred Lansing’s Endurance. As a kid, I’d read and re-read My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George. In 2014, these were my teachers: the people who ushered me into an idea of nature that I found both compelling and exclusive. I loved these books, and they confused me. I knew in my body that land and race and politics and nature are all lyrics to the same song, but it felt like every time these writers talked about going outside, they didn’t say boo about how white their version of outside was.
—
And I return the question to anyone who spends time outside: Who taught you how to be outside? Who teaches you? If your answer is a list of white men or women, know that your understanding of nature is incomplete and impoverished. Read Black, Indigenous, and Asian writers. Support organizations like @indigenouswomenhike , @outdoorafro, @wilddiversity, or @queernature that are working to shift narratives about the outdoors. Go outside, not as an escape from the world and its people, but as a way to connect with all of life more deeply.

On Sunday August 16th, Osprey ambassador David Xiao was climbing with a partner on Mount Sir Donald near Revelstoke when he fell to his death.  Tuesday would have been his 26th birthday.
—
David had an infectious smile and shared his love of the outdoors with everyone he met. From climbing to skiing to thru-hiking, adventure was in his bones. He had a kind and curious soul; the type that radiates positivity and inspires you to try new things. From the lens of his camera, he passionately shared his adventures with us all, so that we too would fall in love with what he loved most.
—
“I was born and raised within a city of concrete and steel in China and never felt a connection to the outdoors as a kid. I remember the first time my friends took me on a hike after moving to Canada 12 years ago. To my surprise, a hike in the Canadian Rockies meant going out and climbing a mountain, not a walk in the park. I can still picture myself sitting on top of a ridge, mesmerized by the surrounding beauty, the freedom, the joy. I was introduced to a whole new world, a side of reality I never knew existed.”
—
As an Osprey ambassador, we had the joy of helping David pursue his passion for outdoor adventure. When he would talk about the PCT, he lit up. He jumped at every opportunity to share his expertise and knowledge if it would help somebody else try it for the first time.
—
When asked if he could make a 20 second phone call to himself at any point in your life, when would you call and what would you say,” his response was: To my 14-year-old self: Hey, you know that activity where people strap planks to their feet and slide down mountains really really fast? Sounds silly now but turns out you love it. Go try it now, trust me.
—
Thank you David, for sharing your love of the outdoors with so many and being part of the Osprey family. You have taught us to accept any challenge put in our path and to love big. We miss you so much.

"For the past couple weeks, we paused our posts to listen and support the black community and the many black voices that need to be heard. During this time, a global movement took place, inspiring a critical, long-overdue conversation and the beginning of much-needed systems change.
—
As an immediate small step, we donated to two organizations that work tirelessly to address the root causes of social injustice and systemic racism in America: NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. (@naacp) and Color of Change (@colorofchange).
—
Moving forward, and with a heightened sense of purpose, we will continue the longstanding relationships we have with Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC)-focused organizations, like @outdoorafro, @navajo_yes, @latinooutdoors, and more; partner with content creators of color to highlight their work; use our platform to promote BIPOC voices in our blog and social channels; and hold internal meetings to evaluate and identify areas within our business that can be improved.
—
Within Osprey, we have been listening to the conversation, asking tough questions, educating ourselves and developing an action plan to make all communities feel safe, welcome and heard. Our DEI committee has a three-year roadmap in place that includes employee and manager training, department reviews, updated hiring practices, policy and procedure analysis, vision creation and employee culture surveys.

We believe there is simply no place for hatred in our communities, in our outdoor spaces—anywhere in the world, period. We stand with the black community to condemn senseless deaths and injustices that permeate all facets of our society.
—
We realize sharing our beliefs is a small step, and we’re pushing ourselves to do better. Better starts with listening more and developing an evolving action plan.
—
Starting today, we plan to use our platform for good and to ensure BIPOC voices are heard—that means giving them a platform to speak about experiences, better representing people of color through all of our stories and diversifying the non-profits we partner with to better support our core values.

Our community is open and inclusive to all. Our differences fuel our strengths. Together we can end inequality—and we have no patience for those who say that’s impossible.

"""A little while back, I was able to take my daughter on this trip down the Caprock Canyons State Park Trailway. Easing this kid into more self-sufficiency has been a great experience, and she has really started to come into her own this year. We rode 13 gradually descending miles to the campsite on the western side of the Clarity Tunnel. We had a headwind, the temperature was never above 38 F, and mist and drops of rain were an occasional element. Although we stopped to grab a snack and explore a bit of the trailway’s history, we didn’t dottle, and Eva kept the pace moving. Like most kids, one of the more fun parts of camping is getting to and setting your site up. She wanted to be there. But, like most cyclists, she also wanted to simply put her head down and move through less than ideal conditions to our destination.

This 4th grader became the official field assistant to entomologist and National Geographic Explorer, Dr. Isaí Madriz (@IsaiMadriz), who led the largest research expedition to record the behavior of the glacial stonefly (Andiperla sp.) last February. Dr. Madriz’s minimalist insect collection kit was contained within the Seral Pack, which became the ideal mobile lab for the young assistant. Matias loved it so much he nicknamed it “Nerd Pack: Full Edition”, as it contained everything a 9-year-old entomologist could wish for.

"“SIMAMA!” was one of the first words I was taught in Swahili to help me get by. It means to stop, or stand still. I had been hanging off the back of a rickety old motorcycle, aka pikipiki (which is way more fun to say, by the way), with one hand dangling with my camera shooting wildly and the other gripping the metal bar I was straddling, trying to balance and absorb the bumps from the muddy terrain. I had been shooting my friend @nicholekbaker, a pathologist assistant PA and mountain biker, as she ventured into the backcountry of Uganda by bicycle. Nichole was working to improve third world medicine and had big dreams to make it happen. Coming from a place of healing and recovery, focusing her time and energy on helping others was just what she needed to move forward. | Click the link in our bio to learn about Nichole’s work with Path of Logic and how they have supplied communities with solar lights from @mpowerdinc, allowing students to study past sunset and into the dark of night, increasing their odds at successfully passing examinations. | 📷by: @kylie.fly | Featured pack from the Siskin/Salida Series #ospreypacks","Write a captivating travel story about a Swahili phrase, capturing the essence of adventure and humanitarian work in Uganda."

"This week we’ve been doing our best to educate ourselves and stay updated on the latest happenings on our country’s thru hike trails. That being said, @thruhikesyndicate has provided the latest information and recommendations to all of our Thru Hike Syndicate ambassadors regarding their respective trail plans. Based on some of the latest recommendations, we have also strongly advised all on-trail ambassadors to leave the trail immediately or find adequate shelter, for their safety, and the safety of the communities along the trails. We’ll continue to update our ambassadors with the latest news and will work with them to find solutions as the situation evolves, whether that means postponing or finding another hike option for the season. We will continue providing important updates as they become available, and sharing content that encourages inspiring and happy mountain memories. Wherever you are in the world, we hope that you continue to safely recreate and find healing in nature.⁠
@thruhikesyndicate has summarized the latest guidance from some of America’s thru-hike trail associations:⠀
.⁠⠀
The @atc is following the advice of the CDC and the WHO. This means closing ATC visitor’s centers and advising that “all section and thru-hikers to cancel or postpone their hikes.”⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
The @cdtc also advises to “avoid discretionary travel” and also “urge you to stay home and enjoy your local trails and outdoor spaces.”⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
The @PCTA ""asks all those who are already on the trail—as well as those waiting to start—to cancel or postpone your journeys.”⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
The @superiorhikingtrailassociation is asking that SHT users to “hike in place"".
.⁠⠀

"Dear Osprey friends and family,

In recent days we’ve been contacted by a number of you, faithful customers, sharing your stories of adventures delayed or rerouted close to home, even backyards. You sent photos of packed Osprey bags waiting patiently by the front door. You have shown determination, passion and grit, you have inspired us with your fortitude. You have also reminded us how important empathy is in times of crisis because all of you are telling us that you are not giving up. And neither would we. This bit of defiance, this statement of hope will serve as a guiding light for us here at Osprey. Your determination inspires us to take one step forward and then another. This trail is one we hike together.

During this time, osprey.com is open and all orders will ship free. To help support our retail partners, our dealer service team is taking orders and our dealer locator provides an up-to-date view of local store hours, inventory, curbside pick-up and same-day delivery options. Our distribution center is shipping everything.

For our Osprey team and the communities in which we operate, we have pivoted our priorities to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We have implemented a temporary telecommuting policy in our U.S. and European offices. If a role must be performed on-site, we are actively practicing social distancing, increased sanitization, and ensuring safe work environments and practices.

"My friend flew up for the weekend from LA and I promised him (at least a taste of) Washington outdoors. So on Sunday morning, we made the drive through bursts of rainfall and waning sunlight to the Central Cascades. Just as we arrived at the trailhead, it began to snow. As the clouds rolled in, I was afraid we were doomed to a cold and viewless hike (though it would have been a perfectly appropriate version of Washington outdoors.) Luckily, however, the blue sky never left us completely and the day turned out to be stunning. Cold. But stunning. ⁣⁣

I’ve done this hike before and yet - I found myself standing motionless on the ridgeline, mesmerized by snowy Mt. Stuart.

"This summer, a friend and I decided to go for an impromptu overnight camping trip on the summit of a nearby mountain called Mt. English. After bushwhacking for a few hours from the end of a logging road, we came to some beautiful alpine meadows with the wildflowers in full bloom. From here, we made our way up some scree, scrambled to the summit, and got cozy in our sleeping bags for the night. I stayed up and watched the milky way rise about the surrounding mountains on a moonless night-- it was so serene. I woke to frost on my sleeping bag and the sky slowly changing into hues of orange and red. This photo was taken just before leaving the summit, overlooking the glacier below. After that, it was back to the car because my friend had to rush so he wouldn't be late for work that day. All in all, it was a successful mini-adventure. - Vince Schnabl, Osprey Ambassador#ospreypacks | 📷@vincentschnabl | Featured pack from the Rook/Renn Series #ospreypacks #ospreyambassador",Write a captivating camping adventure story about a spontaneous trip to Mt.

"Four of my girlfriends and I spent four days backpacking on the Via Dinarica from outside of Sarajevo to Sutjeska National Park in Bosnia. We saw zero other hikers on the trail the entire way. ZERO! In a land that could be compared in many ways to Yosemite, it was hard to believe that we had it all to ourselves, especially with the fall colors, perfect hiking temps, and sunshine.

During our trip, we met many warm locals who were eager to help us, talk to us (even without sharing a common tongue), and of course share their rakija and food with us. Aside from plenty of bonding time for our friendships to grow even stronger, we rested a LOT, laughed a LOT, slowed life down, put away our phones, and enjoyed getting far (VERY far) off the beaten path, together.

I needed that time desperately, and I'm so grateful to have had the opportunity to finally experience a section of the Via Dinarica with my badass female dream team. | 📷@travelingjackie | Featured pack from the Farpoint/Fairview, Levity/Lumina Series #ospreypacks #ospreyambassador","Write a captivating travel post about a 4-day backpacking trip on the Via Dinarica trail in Bosnia with friends, highlighting solitude, local encounters, and bonding experiences."

"Did you know the idea for @smokeybear came about on August 9, 1944 and the bear quickly became a symbol for forest fire prevention. Not long after in the spring of 1950, a young American black bear cub was rescued from a forest fire in New Mexico. The firefighters named him Smokey because of his bravery. But what does this have to do with backpacking you ask? Well, Smokey and #ospreyambassador @drawingfromnature share the same birthday and to celebrate their milestones, Smokey turning 75 and Andrea turning 30, we teamed up to giveaway a custom painted Smokey Bear pack!

There was no better way to spend the day than to head into the woods to a local bouldering area: Sailing Hawks. There was a route that was calling my name, a route that I had been working for over a year, a route that followed me into my dreams. With my dirtbag crew of climbing friends by my side, I chalked up and started to climb.

"Daylite Artist Series featuring @prettybirdpaper: What are some challenges of having your passion also be your profession? 🔹🔹
It’s like working in your bed. It’s so comfortable, and as far as work goes, it’s pretty amazing. But then when it’s time to go to sleep and you’re in the same place where you worked all day, you don’t sleep as well. Everyone tells you not to do it, because that association is real. So basically, painting doesn’t always get to be as peaceful for me as it once consistently was. I went to a huge stationary tradeshow in May and was so burnt out at the end that I told everyone I was never going to paint another card. (Untrue.) That being said, there are also still times I stay up into the night because I found the perfect playlist and my mind is in another world that's all coming out on the paper.

"We asked @sarahvirginiauhl the eternal question for any artist: how do you know when a piece is done?
🔸🔸🔸 I think this is a place where the business mind needs to meet the artistic mind. My success is based upon a balance of both. If I were to allow myself to stay in my artistic brain, reworking pieces of art until near perfection, I would never get anything done. At a certain point, I bring myself back around to the main thing (for me) which is to tell a story that helps connect someone with the wild places or with themselves. I want my work to provide a sense of connection so that if it gets to the point where I feel like my art can offer that to someone else, I don’t need to stay in it for my own sake. That striving for artistic completion is the carrot that keeps me interested in my own work, in starting a new painting or designing a new project that slowly chips away at that desire for making something truly great. The achievement of this sensation is more of a myth than a daily experience, but I like it that way nonetheless. | Click the link in our bio to win this custom pack! | #ospreypacks #giveaway #art",Write a post featuring @sarahvirginiauhl's insights on balancing artistic vision with business acumen.

"Tune in tonight at 6:30 PM MST to watch @drawingfromnature do a LIVE sketch from her studio in Denver! | What recent project or piece are you most proud of and why?
🔸 
This past summer I was invited by @somethingindependent to be the lead artist for an event they host during the winter & summer @outdoorretailer shows called TRADE SCHOOL (four-days of inspired discussion, original art and informal collision with leading athletes, advocates, entrepreneurs and artists of the outdoor industry). From the start to still now, I feel very honored to have been a part of such an awesome experience and team.
🔸
🔸
 The first step was showing up and starting the conversations. I wanted to incorporate the summer event themes of Women, Water & the West, while taking advantage of the creative power of the group. Then after a little research frenzy and sketchbook inspiration, I pitched the idea to two of my good friends and inspiring artists @pharen_art and @katcarney. They miraculously bought my crazy and we started the process of working to create a collaborative mixed-media collage of our mediums that we wanted to represent the themes through. When all finished, the artworks blew all of our imaginations. | #ospreypacks #art #slowtv #giveaway","Create an engaging post highlighting @drawingfromnature's upcoming LIVE sketch and share her story about her most proud project, TRADE SCHOOL."
"Daylite Artist Series featuring @sarahvirginiauhl 🔹🔹How does your work comment on current social or political issues? 🔹🔹 My artwork carries my personal focus on loving our Earth and being kind to one another.  I am motivated by the organizations I partner with because they tend to be leaders in moving the needle for conservation, climate change, or water issues.  My hope is that the artwork I create can be used as a tool, to bring more people into the conversation around these topics and to feel their own personal connection to these issues.  I am more comfortable making a political statement as an artist by partnering with the experts; groups like The Access Fund, Conservation Colorado, American Rivers, and The Wilderness Society.  If a whimsical painting of an endangered wild and scenic river helps someone learn about how they can help protect rivers, I feel like I have done my job.  If sharing a photo of my adventures into the wild to paint helps someone make more time for themselves to get outside, I feel as though I have done my job.  I believe that every droplet of inspiration shared has an immeasurable ripple effect into peoples lives that then leads them towards actions of their own.

With the help of Tasmanian endurance rider @oneflukeshot, Payson pieced together a 360 mile route across Tasmania that crescendoed in difficulty, beginning on the wild, largely uninhabited northwestern coast and concluded on the white sand beaches of the Bay of Fires after 32 hours and over 34,000 feet of climbing. 

The island brought him face-to-face with three Tiger Snakes, one of the most venomous on the planet, hundreds of wallabies and wombats, and the friendly locals of Tasmania's rural communities.

The forthcoming film, produced in conjunction with Joey Schusler and Thomas Woodson and edited by Aidan Haley, will premier at the 2023 Sea Otter Classic and aims to share stories far beyond the athletic achievement of this ride.

"Did you know that we’re proud members of @conservationalliance who recently announced the Dolores River in Colorado as one of their four Advocacy Priority Campaigns for 2022? Beginning high in the San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado, it flows 230 miles until it joins the Colorado River in Utah’s red rock desert near Moab. McPhee Dam and Reservoir were built in the 1980’s to support the growing agricultural communities in the region, and to provide much-needed water for the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe in Towaoc. 

This year, they will be joining groups advocating for protection of the lower Dolores River through:

💦  A bill to designate a 75,000-acre National Conservation Area spanning from the base of McPhee Reservoir to the San Miguel/Montrose County line, which includes more than 70 miles of the Dolores River, establishes the Ponderosa Gorge Roadless Area, and protects special river values.

They’re partnering with Dolores River Boating Advocates in the effort to protect this beautiful river and surrounding lands.

"""What advice would you give to someone who’s JUST getting started hiking, to encourage and support them?

I began my hiking career on the trails at Oconee Forest Park, a small wooded area behind the intramural sports fields at the University of Georgia. I didn’t really know what hiking was back then, and I didn’t own 'hiking clothes' or trail maps. It was basically impossible to get lost there, due to the small nature of it and the fact that every trail led back to a parking lot. I spent countless hours winding through the woods with my dogs, the trees a refuge from having my nose in textbooks and sitting under fluorescent lights in classrooms. There were no grand views, waterfalls, or picturesque destinations. Just woods, a stream, bugs and wildlife, and dirt beneath my feet.

My biggest piece of advice for someone who’s just starting is to just GO. The destination doesn’t have to be awe-inspiring. The hike doesn’t have to be epic. If you don’t know how to read a map, go where you don’t need one. You don’t have to have the best gear or even the right shoes. Find a safe wooded area near your home, wear whatever you already own, lace up whatever shoes you’ve got, and take a walk. Spend time with dirt under your feet and wind on your skin. Taste and smell the aroma of the trees and plants around you. Get used to the way your body moves on uneven terrain. Find your stride. Learn your pace and your stamina. Start where you’re at."" - @adventurelikeagirl | 📷 by @emtrod90 | Featured pack from the Manta/Mira Series

"The do-everything, own-forever backpack. 

Almost 25 years ago, we set out to design the best backpack ever made. Beloved on the trail, our Aether/Ariel Series has continually set the standard for what a pack should do and what it should weigh. Customizable, perfect-fitting and capable of carrying larger and heavier loads, the all-new Aether/Ariel has undergone a quarter century of evolution to last you a lifetime of trips.

It was then that our founder Mike Pfotenhauer constructed our very first packs in Santa Cruz, California. Today, we’re based in Cortez, Colorado, where each of our custom-fit, high-performing products still pass through Mike’s hands.

We’re thoughtful about every panel, every stitch.

Every week, they hold ""family day,"" a day of no pressure adventure and quality time with his wife, Kath, and their two girls, Mia and Anika. 

''On all of my expeditions since then, I dream about days when I return home, to create our own family adventures big and small. I see in my daughters a growing fascination of what adventures are out there waiting for them, and it stokes me so much that they are getting increasingly excited to explore in bigger way, and they have a big goal set for the near future!'' - Ray

"Every Sunday we go on a Zahab family adventure. Together we decide if it will be a trail run, ski, or something else. This past year, the girls set specific goals, such as completing their first 20km trail run, which evolved into multiple trail runs over 20km. Each year, we’ve set a goal to go on a bigger adventure than the year before when dad gets home from expeditions. 

In 2020, the girls focused their goals on skiing groomers and backcountry, both skate and classic. Due to travel restrictions, our big winter adventure will have to wait, but we won’t let all this training be for not! This week’s ski was an awesome 24km loop with plenty of climbing and a few technical descents, which they go into a tuck, and I curl up into more of a fetal position ‘fear tuck’😂!
